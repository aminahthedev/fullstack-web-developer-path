**Target** : ***Code Everyday of My Life While Learning and Blogging About It***

**Date** : 29 December 2017

Day: 187
------
**Today's Progress** :
1. FreeCodeCamp jQuery & JSON
2. FileCabinet app
3. The Complete Web Developer 2018

**Thoughts** : I keep meaning to update this thing because it really keeps me on track, but things just keep happening and I'm like aaagggghhh but whatevs. I code everyday so I guess that's what matters. I've been working on some Udemy courses as well as FreeCodeCamp.

I also plan on restarting my 100 days of code challenge on January 1st. Yee.

**Target** : ***Learn and Code for at least 5 hours everyday for 30 days***

**Date** : 23 December 2017

Day: 181
------
**Today's Progress** :
1. FreeCodeCamp jQuery

**Thoughts** : These last few weeks have been spent job hunting, getting my portfolio in tip top shape and figuring out who I am as a developer. The days of chasing after multiple frameworks is over. I realized that I was beginning to feel overwhelmed trying to learn too many things that paralleled each other at the same time. Now, I'm focusing on growing as a Rails developer and plan to build my knowledge of React on top of that.

Beyond that, though I hadn't been updating my log, I have coded at least once a day since my hiatus.

Day: 142
------
**Today's Progress** :
1. Codecademy React JS

**Thoughts** : So I wasn't able to get to the second half of the React JS course yesterday, but I went back and re-learned some things I wasn't fully grasping and I feel so much better about it going forward. I also want to make the tic tac toe app responsive, so I'll be doing that at some point today.

**Today's Progress** :
1. FCC Javascript Algorithms (FINISHED)
2. Codecademy React JS
3. Sean Groff's React Challenge (2/5)

**Thoughts** : Today's agenda is to finish the FCC intermediate algorithms and continue with Codecademy's Part I of the Reactjs course. Hopefully I will finish that one as well and be able to start on the second half.

Day: 140
------
**Today's Progress** :
1. FCC Javascript Algorithms


**Thoughts** : Went back to the algorithms. Accidentally completed one of the intermediate algorithms, but that was pretty cool because it was relatively easy. I'll be working on projects instead of focusing on learning new things as my brain can't seem to retain anything at the moment.

I worked on Julie's site and attempted to deploy it to Heroku. That was madness, I was successful to a certain extent; I can't really do anything because of the database, I think. I need to find a tutorial on how to setup the database. We shall see how that works out.

**Thoughts** : Another day of mental exhaustion, I have no idea where it's coming from. Maybe the weather...🤷🏼‍

Day: 137

**Today's Progress** :
1. React Codecademy


**Thoughts** : I have been extremely unmotivated today. These are the kinds of days where I know that self-care is extremely important and taking care of my body will ultimately help me be a better programmer. So I've taking it easy, though I did complete another section Codecademy's React course.

The only thing my mind can wrap around is working on projects, so that's what I've been doing.

**Today's Progress** :
1. React Codecademy


**Thoughts** : Today has been a bit busy, but I was able to work more on my Beautiful, Meaningful project that I came up with while still in DBC. It's looking better and better and working nicely. I'm also a little distracted, perhaps because of the gorgeous weather in Chicago, but I've work to do!

I looked over Codecademy's React course a little bit this morning, going back over JSX so that I have no misunderstandings. It's amazing how much I picked up the second time around! I see that's going to be a new thing for me, looking at things 2 or 3 times after the initial look-over.

Day: 135

**Today's Progress** :
1. React tutorial


**Thoughts** : My mentor has advised me to focus on learning React. I guess, not so much advised, but suggested. At the end of the day it's my decision, but I trust him as he is a senior software engineer and knows waaaaay more than me.

I completed the tic-tac-toe tutorial from the React org and feel a teeny bit more knowledgeable about things going forward, but there is so much I need to learn.

Blasted through more of the JS algorithms today. I feel so much more confident about creating JavaScript functions and following directions to make something happen. Going from Ruby to JavaScript was scary, but it feels great! We'll see what I'll be saying once I get to the intermediate algorithm challenges though!

Worked more on the portfolio as well. Things are more cohesive and not all over the place like the first two times I made a portfolio for the challenge. I'll be adding media queries over the next couple of days to make it more mobile responsive with JS and all that jazz. Squee!

Day: 134

**Today's Progress** :
1. Started FCC's javascript algorithm section
2. Worked on my FCC portfolio


**Thoughts** : I didn't really have any thoughts, just pumped to start the algorithm section and be impressed with how far I've come. When I started FCC in January, I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without having gone to Dev Boot Camp. I've learned so much about coding and it shows.

Day: 133
------
**Today's Progress** :
1. Finished FCC's Object-Oriented Javascript section
2. Completed Flexbox Froggy


**Thoughts** : Things are going well. I'm pretty nervous about starting the Algorithm section of Free Code Camp. I'm pretty decent at Ruby algorithms, but I'm not as comfortable with JS. So...this will be an ultimate test! I'm excited though, because I love a challenge and refuse to give up! Also, I'll be completing the Flexbox courses today so that I can finish my portfolio.

I finished Flexbox froggy and it was a lot of fun! I watched half of Wes Bos's Flexbox videos and was able to bring over the knowledge I'd learned from Wes to Froggy and really understand what I was doing. I feel so much more confident going forward using flex box. It's basically a miracle!

Day: 130

**Today's Progress** : Again, I'm writing this the day after, which I don't think will be sustainable in the long run, but life...ya know? Yesterday I went back to FCC and began where I left off in the JavaScript section. Made it to about 75% through and will complete today (2 November). Also decided to sign up for the Codecademy pro course, as I think it works best with the way that I learn. Code School is cool too, but I don't like watching videos. Maybe I supplement FCC and Codecademy with it...we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I went back on Angular and decided to work with React since my mentor has more knowledge of it. I hope that I made the right decision and don't seem flippy floppy when it comes to making decisions. The biggest reason I switched so easily to React was because I know for a fact that once I get down and dirty with React to the point of understanding it fully, I'm going to go back to Angular; it's inevitable, just a matter of time. Either way, I'm excited about learning these frameworks.

**Date** : 30 October 2017 (Today is 1 November)

Day : One hundred and something
------
**Today's Progress** : Today I continued learning React, will set aside Angular for now. Yesterday I completed the Intro to Javascript on Codecademy, but there's another one that's the main one or something? I don't know...but I'll be completing that one too. Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing

**Thing(s) learned**: JavaScript basics, intro to React and Angular
