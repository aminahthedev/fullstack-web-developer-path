**Today's Progress** :
1. Blog post about Ruby closures
2. Add categories to mah blog

**Thoughts:**

Today I had an interview and got to speak with my mentor so not much coding happened...until now. I'm going through HackerRank, doing some algorithms, and I came upon closures in Ruby. When we learned about blocks and methods, we were told that they were apart of a bigger collective called "closures". Now I know and will be writing a blog post about it.

This means that I now need to add categories to muh blog so I can separate the concerns and topics that I'm writing about. Fun project! Legit!

**Today's Progress** :
1. Blog post about Promises

**Thoughts:**
Today is a blah day. I decided to write the first post on my AtD blog. That was fun. But now I don't really feel like looking at code, even though I really need to.

**Today's Progress** :
1. CWD section 11

**Thoughts:**
(I Love You Noah)

Today not too much coding happened for obvious reasons, but I did gain some traction on CWD section 11. DOM manipluation is interesting and I'm determined to get under the hood and make something fun and interesting. Last night I finished the Ruby SoloLearn course and am aiming to redo the whole JavaScript one and then move on to Java (for mobile app dev).

Things are moving along slowly, but I'm confident that they're going to be picking up speed soon.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Fatimah's Blog
2. CWD section 11

**Thoughts:**
Today was full of testing. TDD, BDD, my brain hurts. But, the models are good to go. The controllers are up next. It's interesting working from a testing stand point instead of just throwing a website together. I like it and know things will move faster once I get used to it and learn how to test properly and with whichever tools (requests vs controllers; capybara vs rspec; etc)

The rest of the night I'll be completing the CWD sections.

**Today's Progress** :
1. My site
2. Fatimah's Blog

**Thoughts:**
Yesterday was filled mostly with debugging my site after deploying it to heroku. For some reason it wasn't migrating the author_id changes I'd made to the post migration file. Eventually I got it working again and the blog is officially up and working on the site.

Today I'm probably just going to focus on what I know and just make Fatimah's blog in rails and not muddle around with making the frontend in react. I don't care what company's want anymore, I'm wasting too much time trying to do all this stuff and not learning what I need to learn for my own personal growth and getting my portfolio A-10.

**Today's Progress** :
1. My site

**Thoughts:**
So I didn't get the freelance job! They emailed me the day I was supposed to start and told me they gave the position to someone internal. Wow what a disappointment. It's a lesson in not allowing the decisions of others to affect my view of my worth as a developer. And it won't.

Last night I finally completed the main functionality of my blog, though I haven't deployed it yet. There are a few tweaks I want to make before official deployment.

Today there will be a lot of getting my head back in the game. Despite trying not to let the loss effect me, I got a bit discombobulated yesterday because of the news. Because they were using Vue.js, I'd set a plan to learn that. Now since there's no reason to, I need to figure out my next steps. Shouldn't be too hard. Beefing up the portfolio is definitely #1.

**Today's Progress** :
1. My site

**Thoughts:**
So I got the freelance job! I've been working hard trying to get my blog up so I can add those interview questions, and I have successfully finished (for the most part; still got some styling I want to add, but functionality is pretty much complete)! I added the hamburgler navigation as well, so things are progressing very smoothly.

Tomorrow I'll talk to my mentor and watch some VueJS videos to get up to speed on things and then maybe work on the CWD course. I'm excited and nervous but mostly really, really relieved.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Udacity DOM
2. Udemy CWD

**Thoughts:**
Today I had an interview for a temp freelance job. I'm not sure how I did, but I guess we shall see.

I still have a lot to do and am sort of reeling from the interview, but I need to stay focused and get done what I have on my to do list. This is absolutely essential as a freelance developer, staying on task.

Today I want to finish the Udacity course and get more of the CWD course done. I also want to teach myself how to create a react view with rails backend blog for one of my clients. That is my number 1 priority actually. And eventually transfer ASMUA to a React app. It's so exciting to be able to use these technologies to create something awesome.

Oh! Biggest excitement of the day, I did the fDG pre-launch, but still have more to do. There is so much to create and fix for this project, it's not even funny. But it's happening and that's all that matters.

4. fDG


**Thoughts:**
I've been really discombobulated with trying to get fDG off the ground for the pre-launch on monday. There are still a few things I need to do, but overall, I'm done for the most part.

Learning has been taking place, just not logging it well. The nights tend to be all over the place; yesterday I completed the DOM section on Udacity. Today I completed the JavaScript section on Udemy CWD and now will be working on ASMUA again to turn it into a SPA instead of being overwhelmed by trying to make it a MPA. Should be fun!

There is a lot to do today and I have rehearsals, so fingers crossed that much gets accomplished. I realized yesterday that my brain doesn't seem to work well on programming before 10 AM, so I'll reserve project management stuff for the early morning and coding closer to mid-morning.

Today will be spent catching up on what I missed out on yesterday from finishing that RQG. At some point I also want to add some animations to the RQG to make more interactive.

Completed all of the Udacity lessons I set out for today.

Pushed the random quote generate to my portfolio. I have so much to create and do, I'm so tired. This feels so daunting, but I know that I am capable and will get through it.

Successfully completed a project for the React course with Maximillian on Udemy. I must say that I am uber proud of myself.

------
**Today's Progress** :

**Thoughts** : Yesterday was spent mostly doing a writeup for a potential job and doing another interview. I rehashed how ASMUA for more modern design.

Today I received the news that I was accepted into the Google scholars udacity program, which isn't really the thing until I finish this first part and then I'll be accepted into the nanodegree program. So today was spent working on that stuff and working on React. It's been a long and dreary day.

**Thoughts** : Today's project is to turn ASMUA into a react app.

Okay, so update: the react app didn't pan through. The time constraint is too large, but it will be a future project that I endeavor to at some point when I have more time. I worked on ASMUA all day yesterday, as I need it done by monday, and it's almost finished so I can start working on other things...

4. My portfolio site

**Thoughts** : I woke up super early this morning and started working on the Hartl Rails Tutorial and RoR on the Odin Project. As much as I know, there's no harm in going back and learning more and filling in any gaps in knowledge that I might have.

Later in the morning started the Local Weather App for FreeCodeCamp.

Got to work on Amber's MUA site. It's looking pretty good so far!

The jQuery was a little dusty so I'll be going back through FreeCodeCamp's jQuery section.

The next projects I'll be finishing up this weekend:
- Weather app
- Amber's MUA Site
- Separating the pages of my site and completing the blog

**Thoughts** : Yesterday was full of errands so no coding happened.
Today I'm starting the random quote generator, and I just learned that you set a function to a button by giving it the attribute *onClick*. Nice.

Also learned that variable height AKA *vh* is great for mobile-first websites. I'm down with that!

**Thoughts** : Today I decided to start my 100DaysofCode over from Day 1, but from where I'm currently at on my journey.

With that said, today was rough because I had an amazing NYE celebration and I was in bed all day (haha). But, right before bed time, I decided to fumble around with some HAML and background image with text overlay issue I was having and it works now! I'm thinking I must have had a cache issue because I used the exact same CSS code that I tried before and it didn't work then, but it works now so that's my queue to go to bed. :-D

I'll be writing a blog post about this. ***Must REMEMBER!***

**Today's Progress** :

**Thoughts** : These last few weeks have been spent job hunting, getting my portfolio in tip top shape and figuring out who I am as a developer. The days of chasing after multiple frameworks is over. I realized that I was beginning to feel overwhelmed trying to learn too many things that paralleled each other at the same time. Now, I'm focusing on growing as a Rails developer and plan to build my knowledge of React on top of that.

Beyond that, though I hadn't been updating my log, I have coded at least once a day since my hiatus.

**Thoughts** : Went back to the algorithms. Accidentally completed one of the intermediate algorithms, but that was pretty cool because it was relatively easy. I'll be working on projects instead of focusing on learning new things as my brain can't seem to retain anything at the moment.

I worked on Julie's site and attempted to deploy it to Heroku. That was madness, I was successful to a certain extent; I can't really do anything because of the database, I think. I need to find a tutorial on how to setup the database. We shall see how that works out.

The only thing my mind can wrap around is working on projects, so that's what I've been doing.

**Thoughts** : Today has been a bit busy, but I was able to work more on my Beautiful, Meaningful project that I came up with while still in DBC. It's looking better and better and working nicely. I'm also a little distracted, perhaps because of the gorgeous weather in Chicago, but I've work to do!

I looked over Codecademy's React course a little bit this morning, going back over JSX so that I have no misunderstandings. It's amazing how much I picked up the second time around! I see that's going to be a new thing for me, looking at things 2 or 3 times after the initial look-over.

**Today's Progress** :
1. React tutorial


**Thoughts** : My mentor has advised me to focus on learning React. I guess, not so much advised, but suggested. At the end of the day it's my decision, but I trust him as he is a senior software engineer and knows waaaaay more than me.

I completed the tic-tac-toe tutorial from the React org and feel a teeny bit more knowledgeable about things going forward, but there is so much I need to learn.

Blasted through more of the JS algorithms today. I feel so much more confident about creating JavaScript functions and following directions to make something happen. Going from Ruby to JavaScript was scary, but it feels great! We'll see what I'll be saying once I get to the intermediate algorithm challenges though!

Worked more on the portfolio as well. Things are more cohesive and not all over the place like the first two times I made a portfolio for the challenge. I'll be adding media queries over the next couple of days to make it more mobile responsive with JS and all that jazz. Squee!

**Thoughts** : Things are going well. I'm pretty nervous about starting the Algorithm section of Free Code Camp. I'm pretty decent at Ruby algorithms, but I'm not as comfortable with JS. So...this will be an ultimate test! I'm excited though, because I love a challenge and refuse to give up! Also, I'll be completing the Flexbox courses today so that I can finish my portfolio.

I finished Flexbox froggy and it was a lot of fun! I watched half of Wes Bos's Flexbox videos and was able to bring over the knowledge I'd learned from Wes to Froggy and really understand what I was doing. I feel so much more confident going forward using flex box. It's basically a miracle!

**Today's Progress** : Again, I'm writing this the day after, which I don't think will be sustainable in the long run, but life...ya know? Yesterday I went back to FCC and began where I left off in the JavaScript section. Made it to about 75% through and will complete today (2 November). Also decided to sign up for the Codecademy pro course, as I think it works best with the way that I learn. Code School is cool too, but I don't like watching videos. Maybe I supplement FCC and Codecademy with it...we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I went back on Angular and decided to work with React since my mentor has more knowledge of it. I hope that I made the right decision and don't seem flippy floppy when it comes to making decisions. The biggest reason I switched so easily to React was because I know for a fact that once I get down and dirty with React to the point of understanding it fully, I'm going to go back to Angular; it's inevitable, just a matter of time. Either way, I'm excited about learning these frameworks.

Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing

**Link to work** : N/A

**Thing(s) learned**: JavaScript basics, intro to React and Angular
