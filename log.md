**Today's Progress** : Again, I'm writing this the day after, which I don't think will be sustainable in the long run, but life...ya know? Yesterday I went back to FCC and began where I left off in the JavaScript section. Made it to about 75% through and will complete today (2 November). Also decided to sign up for the Codecademy pro course, as I think it works best with the way that I learn. Code School is cool too, but I don't like watching videos. Maybe I supplement FCC and Codecademy with it...we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I went back on Angular and decided to work with React since my mentor has more knowledge of it. I hope that I made the right decision and don't seem flippy floppy when it comes to making decisions. The biggest reason I switched so easily to React was because I know for a fact that once I get down and dirty with React to the point of understanding it fully, I'm going to go back to Angular; it's inevitable, just a matter of time. Either way, I'm excited about learning these frameworks.

**Start Date** : 30 October 2017 (Today is 1 November)

Day : One hundred and something
------
**Today's Progress** : Today I continued learning React, will set aside Angular for now. Yesterday I completed the Intro to Javascript on Codecademy, but there's another one that's the main one or something? I don't know...but I'll be completing that one too. Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing
