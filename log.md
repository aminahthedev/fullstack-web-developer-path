**Today's Progress** :
1. My site

**Thoughts:**
So I got the freelance job! I've been working hard trying to get my blog up so I can add those interview questions, and I have successfully finished (for the most part; still got some styling I want to add, but functionality is pretty much complete)! I added the hamburgler navigation as well, so things are progressing very smoothly.

Tomorrow I'll talk to my mentor and watch some VueJS videos to get up to speed on things and then maybe work on the CWD course. I'm excited and nervous but mostly really, really relieved.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Udacity DOM
2. Udemy CWD

**Thoughts:**
Today I had an interview for a temp freelance job. I'm not sure how I did, but I guess we shall see.

I still have a lot to do and am sort of reeling from the interview, but I need to stay focused and get done what I have on my to do list. This is absolutely essential as a freelance developer, staying on task.

Today I want to finish the Udacity course and get more of the CWD course done. I also want to teach myself how to create a react view with rails backend blog for one of my clients. That is my number 1 priority actually. And eventually transfer ASMUA to a React app. It's so exciting to be able to use these technologies to create something awesome.

Oh! Biggest excitement of the day, I did the fDG pre-launch, but still have more to do. There is so much to create and fix for this project, it's not even funny. But it's happening and that's all that matters.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Udacity DOM
2. Udemy CWD
3. ASMUA
4. fDG


**Thoughts:**
I've been really discombobulated with trying to get fDG off the ground for the pre-launch on monday. There are still a few things I need to do, but overall, I'm done for the most part.

Learning has been taking place, just not logging it well. The nights tend to be all over the place; yesterday I completed the DOM section on Udacity. Today I completed the JavaScript section on Udemy CWD and now will be working on ASMUA again to turn it into a SPA instead of being overwhelmed by trying to make it a MPA. Should be fun!

**Thoughts:**
Yesterday was rough. I got really discouraged and tired for absolutely no reason. Anyway, today the grind is back on and I'm really excited to accomplish some React.js things

**Today's Progress** :
1. Udacity - 2 lessons


There is a lot to do today and I have rehearsals, so fingers crossed that much gets accomplished. I realized yesterday that my brain doesn't seem to work well on programming before 10 AM, so I'll reserve project management stuff for the early morning and coding closer to mid-morning.

2. CWD - 2 lessons


Written in retro: I accomplished a lot yesterday. I even came up with a great idea that'll soon come to fruition. My little baby idea. Weeeee!

I started on FZ's blog and updated my own portfolio again.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Udacity - 2 lessons
2. CWD - 2 lessons
3. Animations to RQG

Today will be spent catching up on what I missed out on yesterday from finishing that RQG. At some point I also want to add some animations to the RQG to make more interactive.

Completed all of the Udacity lessons I set out for today.

Pushed the random quote generate to my portfolio. I have so much to create and do, I'm so tired. This feels so daunting, but I know that I am capable and will get through it.

**Today's Progress** : Turning the random quote generator into a react app. This should be fun and interesting using what I learned yesterday to make it happen! I'm excited.

I successfully built and launched my Random Quote Generator in React! It was a tedious endeavor, but it happened and is in the world.

**Today's Progress** : Pulling out my hair at all the resources. I need to chill and choose SOMETHING. (insert exasperation) It's going to be okay. Today I will turn my javascript projects into react. Fingers crossed I don't get lost in the sauce.

Successfully completed a project for the React course with Maximillian on Udemy. I must say that I am uber proud of myself.

Day: 8 & 9
------
**Today's Progress** :

**Thoughts** : Yesterday was spent mostly doing a writeup for a potential job and doing another interview. I rehashed how ASMUA for more modern design.

Today I received the news that I was accepted into the Google scholars udacity program, which isn't really the thing until I finish this first part and then I'll be accepted into the nanodegree program. So today was spent working on that stuff and working on React. It's been a long and dreary day.

**Today's Progress** :
1. ASMUA

**Thoughts** : Today I will HOPEFULLY be able to finish the site and work on other things. Like Fatimah's Blog. URGH!!! Lazy days.

I still have a little bit more to do on ASMUA, but the majority of it is done. Yes.

**Today's Progress** :
1. ASMUA as React.js app (not)

**Thoughts** : Today's project is to turn ASMUA into a react app.

Okay, so update: the react app didn't pan through. The time constraint is too large, but it will be a future project that I endeavor to at some point when I have more time. I worked on ASMUA all day yesterday, as I need it done by monday, and it's almost finished so I can start working on other things...

Day: 4

**Today's Progress** :
1. Rails Tutorial
2. Local Weather App
3. ASMUA
4. My portfolio site

**Thoughts** : I woke up super early this morning and started working on the Hartl Rails Tutorial and RoR on the Odin Project. As much as I know, there's no harm in going back and learning more and filling in any gaps in knowledge that I might have.

Later in the morning started the Local Weather App for FreeCodeCamp.

Got to work on Amber's MUA site. It's looking pretty good so far!

**Today's Progress** :
1. Random Quote Generator
2. FreeCodeCamp jQuery section

**Thoughts** : Today I had to add a tweeting capability for the RQG, which was a success. Yusss.
The jQuery was a little dusty so I'll be going back through FreeCodeCamp's jQuery section.  

The next projects I'll be finishing up this weekend:
- Weather app
- Amber's MUA Site
- Separating the pages of my site and completing the blog

**Today's Progress** :
1. Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts** : Yesterday was full of errands so no coding happened.
Today I'm starting the random quote generator, and I just learned that you set a function to a button by giving it the attribute *onClick*. Nice.

Also learned that variable height AKA *vh* is great for mobile-first websites. I'm down with that!

**Today's Progress** :
1. FileCabinet

**Thoughts** : Today I decided to start my 100DaysofCode over from Day 1, but from where I'm currently at on my journey.

With that said, today was rough because I had an amazing NYE celebration and I was in bed all day (haha). But, right before bed time, I decided to fumble around with some HAML and background image with text overlay issue I was having and it works now! I'm thinking I must have had a cache issue because I used the exact same CSS code that I tried before and it didn't work then, but it works now so that's my queue to go to bed. :-D

I'll be writing a blog post about this. ***Must REMEMBER!***

**Today's Progress** :
1. FreeCodeCamp jQuery & JSON
2. FileCabinet app
3. The Complete Web Developer 2018

**Thoughts** : I keep meaning to update this thing because it really keeps me on track, but things just keep happening and I'm like aaagggghhh but whatevs. I code everyday so I guess that's what matters. I've been working on some Udemy courses as well as FreeCodeCamp.

I also plan on restarting my 100 days of code challenge on January 1st. Yee.

**Today's Progress** :
1. FreeCodeCamp jQuery

**Thoughts** : These last few weeks have been spent job hunting, getting my portfolio in tip top shape and figuring out who I am as a developer. The days of chasing after multiple frameworks is over. I realized that I was beginning to feel overwhelmed trying to learn too many things that paralleled each other at the same time. Now, I'm focusing on growing as a Rails developer and plan to build my knowledge of React on top of that.

Beyond that, though I hadn't been updating my log, I have coded at least once a day since my hiatus.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Codecademy React JS

**Thoughts** : So I wasn't able to get to the second half of the React JS course yesterday, but I went back and re-learned some things I wasn't fully grasping and I feel so much better about it going forward. I also want to make the tic tac toe app responsive, so I'll be doing that at some point today.

2. Codecademy React JS
3. Sean Groff's React Challenge (2/5)

**Thoughts** : Today's agenda is to finish the FCC intermediate algorithms and continue with Codecademy's Part I of the Reactjs course. Hopefully I will finish that one as well and be able to start on the second half.

**Today's Progress** :
1. FCC Javascript Algorithms


**Thoughts** : Went back to the algorithms. Accidentally completed one of the intermediate algorithms, but that was pretty cool because it was relatively easy. I'll be working on projects instead of focusing on learning new things as my brain can't seem to retain anything at the moment.

I worked on Julie's site and attempted to deploy it to Heroku. That was madness, I was successful to a certain extent; I can't really do anything because of the database, I think. I need to find a tutorial on how to setup the database. We shall see how that works out.

1. React Codecademy


**Thoughts** : I have been extremely unmotivated today. These are the kinds of days where I know that self-care is extremely important and taking care of my body will ultimately help me be a better programmer. So I've taking it easy, though I did complete another section Codecademy's React course.

The only thing my mind can wrap around is working on projects, so that's what I've been doing.

**Today's Progress** :
1. React Codecademy


**Thoughts** : Today has been a bit busy, but I was able to work more on my Beautiful, Meaningful project that I came up with while still in DBC. It's looking better and better and working nicely. I'm also a little distracted, perhaps because of the gorgeous weather in Chicago, but I've work to do!

I looked over Codecademy's React course a little bit this morning, going back over JSX so that I have no misunderstandings. It's amazing how much I picked up the second time around! I see that's going to be a new thing for me, looking at things 2 or 3 times after the initial look-over.

**Today's Progress** :
1. React tutorial


**Thoughts** : My mentor has advised me to focus on learning React. I guess, not so much advised, but suggested. At the end of the day it's my decision, but I trust him as he is a senior software engineer and knows waaaaay more than me.

I completed the tic-tac-toe tutorial from the React org and feel a teeny bit more knowledgeable about things going forward, but there is so much I need to learn.

Blasted through more of the JS algorithms today. I feel so much more confident about creating JavaScript functions and following directions to make something happen. Going from Ruby to JavaScript was scary, but it feels great! We'll see what I'll be saying once I get to the intermediate algorithm challenges though!

Worked more on the portfolio as well. Things are more cohesive and not all over the place like the first two times I made a portfolio for the challenge. I'll be adding media queries over the next couple of days to make it more mobile responsive with JS and all that jazz. Squee!

**Today's Progress** :
1. Started FCC's javascript algorithm section
2. Worked on my FCC portfolio


**Thoughts** : I didn't really have any thoughts, just pumped to start the algorithm section and be impressed with how far I've come. When I started FCC in January, I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without having gone to Dev Boot Camp. I've learned so much about coding and it shows.

**Today's Progress** :
1. Finished FCC's Object-Oriented Javascript section
2. Completed Flexbox Froggy


**Thoughts** : Things are going well. I'm pretty nervous about starting the Algorithm section of Free Code Camp. I'm pretty decent at Ruby algorithms, but I'm not as comfortable with JS. So...this will be an ultimate test! I'm excited though, because I love a challenge and refuse to give up! Also, I'll be completing the Flexbox courses today so that I can finish my portfolio.

I finished Flexbox froggy and it was a lot of fun! I watched half of Wes Bos's Flexbox videos and was able to bring over the knowledge I'd learned from Wes to Froggy and really understand what I was doing. I feel so much more confident going forward using flex box. It's basically a miracle!

**Today's Progress** : Again, I'm writing this the day after, which I don't think will be sustainable in the long run, but life...ya know? Yesterday I went back to FCC and began where I left off in the JavaScript section. Made it to about 75% through and will complete today (2 November). Also decided to sign up for the Codecademy pro course, as I think it works best with the way that I learn. Code School is cool too, but I don't like watching videos. Maybe I supplement FCC and Codecademy with it...we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I went back on Angular and decided to work with React since my mentor has more knowledge of it. I hope that I made the right decision and don't seem flippy floppy when it comes to making decisions. The biggest reason I switched so easily to React was because I know for a fact that once I get down and dirty with React to the point of understanding it fully, I'm going to go back to Angular; it's inevitable, just a matter of time. Either way, I'm excited about learning these frameworks.

**Today's Progress** : Today I continued learning React, will set aside Angular for now. Yesterday I completed the Intro to Javascript on Codecademy, but there's another one that's the main one or something? I don't know...but I'll be completing that one too. Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing
