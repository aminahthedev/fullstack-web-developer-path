**Target** : ***Learn and Code for at least 5 hours everyday for 30 days***

Day: 133

**Today's Progress** :
1. Finished FCC's Object-Oriented Javascript section
2. Completed Flexbox Froggy


**Thoughts** : Things are going well. I'm pretty nervous about starting the Algorithm section of Free Code Camp. I'm pretty decent at Ruby algorithms, but I'm not as comfortable with JS. So...this will be an ultimate test! I'm excited though, because I love a challenge and refuse to give up! Also, I'll be completing the Flexbox courses today so that I can finish my portfolio.

I finished Flexbox froggy and it was a lot of fun! I watched half of Wes Bos's Flexbox videos and was able to bring over the knowledge I'd learned from Wes to Froggy and really understand what I was doing. I feel so much more confident going forward using flex box. It's basically a miracle!

Day: 130

**Today's Progress** : Again, I'm writing this the day after, which I don't think will be sustainable in the long run, but life...ya know? Yesterday I went back to FCC and began where I left off in the JavaScript section. Made it to about 75% through and will complete today (2 November). Also decided to sign up for the Codecademy pro course, as I think it works best with the way that I learn. Code School is cool too, but I don't like watching videos. Maybe I supplement FCC and Codecademy with it...we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I went back on Angular and decided to work with React since my mentor has more knowledge of it. I hope that I made the right decision and don't seem flippy floppy when it comes to making decisions. The biggest reason I switched so easily to React was because I know for a fact that once I get down and dirty with React to the point of understanding it fully, I'm going to go back to Angular; it's inevitable, just a matter of time. Either way, I'm excited about learning these frameworks.

**Target** : ***Learn and Code for at least 5 hours everyday for 30 days***

**Start Date** : 30 October 2017 (Today is 1 November)

Day : One hundred and something
------
**Today's Progress** : Today I continued learning React, will set aside Angular for now. Yesterday I completed the Intro to Javascript on Codecademy, but there's another one that's the main one or something? I don't know...but I'll be completing that one too. Also, my mentor suggested that I use Code School, which I will look into.

**Thoughts** : I'm  nervous, because I want to build things and get a job, but there's so much to learn and build...I just want to stay focused on growing as a developer and not get caught up in rabbit-holing
